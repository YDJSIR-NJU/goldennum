navbar_help_brief: "
There are N players, begin a competition round of Goldennum. Every round, every player submits 2
float numbers in the open interval (0, 100) to the server. At the end of the round, the server will
calculate the average of the numbers submitted during this round as AVG. Then the Goldennum of the
round is calculated as AVG * 0.618. For every submitted number, if it is the closest number to the
Goldennum, the submitter gets N-2 points, if it is the furthest number from the Goldennum, the
submitter gets -2 points, otherwise, the submitter gets no points. After the rounds ends, player
with the most points wins the game.
